=== /configprops

This endpoint is a report on the Spring Boot `@ConfigurationProperties`
beans. Beans with this annotation are bound to the `Environment` on
startup, so they reflect the externalised configuration of the application.
Beans are listed by name. 
A bean that is added using `@EnableConfigurationProperties` will have
a conventional name: `<prefix>.CONFIGURATION_PROPERTIES`, where
`<prefix>` is the environment key prefix specified in the 
`@ConfigurationProperties` annotation.
