=== /autoconfig

This endpoint is a report on the Spring Boot Autoconfiguration process
that happened when your application started up. It lists all the 
`@Conditional` annotations that were evaluated as the context started
and in each case it gives an indication of if (and why) the condition
matched. A positive match results in a bean being included in the context, 
and a negative result means the opposite (the beans's class may not even 
be loaded).

The report is split into 2 parts, positive matches first, and then negative.
If the context is a hierarchy, there is also a separate report on the parent
context with the same format (and recursively up to the top of the hierarchy).

NOTE: the report is actually about `@Conditional` evaluation not autoconfiguration
per se, but most autoconfiguration features use `@Conditional` heavily, so there is
a lot of overlap.
