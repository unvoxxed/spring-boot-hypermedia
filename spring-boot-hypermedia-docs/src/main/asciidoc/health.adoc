=== /health

This endpoint is an indication of the health of the application.
It has an overall status ("UP", "DOWN" etc.), which is the only thing
you see unless either you are authenticated or the endpoint is marked
as `sensitive=false` (`endpoints.health.sensitive=false`). 

The HTTP code in the response reflects the status (e.g. "UP" = 200,
"OUT_OF_SERVICE"=503, "DOWN"=503). The mappings can be changed by
configuring `endpoints.health.mapping.<STATUS>=XXX`.
