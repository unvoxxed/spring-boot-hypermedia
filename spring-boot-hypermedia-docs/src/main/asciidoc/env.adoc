=== /env

This endpoint is a dump of the Spring `Environment`. It lists the active
profiles and all the `PropertySources` in the `Environment` (the ones that
are listed first take precedence when binding to `@ConfigurationProperties`
or `@Value`). Normally you will see the Java `System` properties and the
OS environment variables in their own `PropertySources` plus any `.properties`
or `.yml` files used to configure the application on start up.
