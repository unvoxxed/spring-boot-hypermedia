= Spring Boot Actuator Endpoints
:toc: left

Actuator endpoints allow you to monitor and interact with your application. Spring Boot
includes a number of built-in endpoints and you can also add your own. For example the
`health` endpoint provides basic application health information.

The way that endpoints are exposed will depend on the type of technology that you choose.
Most applications choose HTTP monitoring, where the ID of the endpoint is mapped
to a URL. For example, by default, the `health` endpoint will be mapped to `/health`.

== Hypermedia Support

If https://projects.spring.io/spring-hateoas[Spring HATEOAS] is enabled 
(i.e. if it is on the classpath by default) then the Actuator
endpoint responses are enhanced with hypermedia in the form of "links". The default
media type for responses is http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[HAL], resulting
in each resource having an extra property called "_links". You can change the
media type to another one supported by Spring HATEOAS by providing your own 
`@EnableHypermedia` annotation and custom providers as necessary.

Example enhanced "/metrics" endpoint with additional "_links":

include::{generated}/metrics/hypermedia/http-response.adoc[]

WARNING: Beware of Actuator endpoint paths clashing with application endpoints.
The easiest way to avoid that is to use a `management.contextPath`, e.g. "/admin".

TIP: You can disable the hypermedia support in Actuator endpoints by setting
`endpoints.links.enabled=false`.

=== Default home page
If the `management.contextPath` is empty, or if the home page provided
by the application happens to be a response body of type `ResourceSupport`, then it will
be enhanced with links to the actuator endpoints. The latter would happen for instance
if you use Spring Data REST to expose `Repository` endpoints. 

Example vanilla "/" endpoint if the `management.contextPath` is empty (the "/admin"
page would be the same with different links if `management.contextPath=/admin`):

include::{generated}/admin/http-response.adoc[]

=== Endpoints with format changes 
Some endpoints in their "raw" form consist of an array (e.g. the "/beans" and the "/trace" endpoints).
These need to be converted to objects (maps) before they can be enhanced with
links, so their contents are inserted as a field named as the endpoint (e.g. "beans" for the "/beans" endpoint).
Example enhanced "/beans" endpoint with additional "_links":

include::{generated}/beans/hypermedia/http-response.adoc[]

== HAL Browser

If Hypermedia is enabled and the HAL format is in use (which is the default), then
you can provide a browser for the resources by including a dependency 
on the https://github.com/mikekelly/hal-browser[HAL browser] webjar. 
For example in Maven:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.webjars</groupId>
	<artifactId>hal-browser</artifactId>
</dependency>
----


or in Gradle

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
   ...
   compile('org.webjars:hal-browser')
   ...
}
----

If you do that then a new endpoint at "/hal" (relative to the `management.contextPath`)
will serve up a static HTML page with some JavaScript that lets you browse the available 
resources. Example:

image::hal-browser.png[HAL Browser]

== Actuator Documentation Browser

You can also provide a browser for the standard generated documentation 
for the Actuator endpoints by including a dependency on the documentation jar. 
For example in Maven:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-hypermedia-docs</artifactId>
</dependency>
----


or in Gradle

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
   ...
   compile('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-hypermedia-docs')
   ...
}
----

If you do that then a new endpoint at "/docs" (relative to the `management.contextPath`)
will serve up a static HTML page with this documentation in it.
