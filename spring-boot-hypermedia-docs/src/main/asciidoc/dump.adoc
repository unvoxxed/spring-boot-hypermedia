=== /dump

This endpoint is a thread dump: the result is a list of threads each with
their name, monitor state and stack. It is the same information as you would
get from `kill -3` of a running Java process. Can be very useful for detecting
issues at runtime, especially sluggish behaviour caused by threads blocked
by slow or unavailable I/O (e.g. if a connection pool is exhausted).

NOTE: some `SecurityManager` implementations might prevent this endpoint
from working.
